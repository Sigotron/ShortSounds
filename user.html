    <p>
      ShortSounds is an Android application that allows users with absolutely no experience to record, mix, and add effects to tracks.  To begin creating a ShortSounds, a user simply records a sound and then adds any desired effects with the simple, intuitive interface.  The user can repeat this process to add more and more tracks to their ShortSounds, adjusting effects and volumes as they go, until they create their desired finished product.  After the user creates the perfect masterpiece of blended and manipulated sounds, they can share their creation with their friends or save their sound in the applicationâ€™s library to come back to and listen to or edit later.  This application is unique because it is simple and intuitive to use, allowing even individuals with no experience to easily create a sounds to share with all of their friends.

    <p>
      A ShortSound is essentially a compilation of separate tracks that each have their own effects.  In order to demonstrate this concept, each track within a ShortSound has its own separate view, where effects can be added and adjusted.
    </p> <p>  
      Effects are designed to be as intuitive as possible, modeled as either adjustable knobs that the user can slide up and down, as with effect controllers in the real world, or modeled as a graph where changes along the x axis affects one variable, and changes along the y axis affect the other variable.
    </p> <p>
      The ShortSounds library is modeled after other software music libraries, with all of the ShortSounds in a list, along with a share button and a play button for each individual sound.
    </p> <p>  
      If a user wishes to create a new ShortSound, the user will first record a track.  After that, the user has the option to add effects to the track or record another track.  Effects can always be added or adjusted later after recording new tracks as well.  After recording and editing as many tracks as desired, the user will save their ShortSound to the ShortSound library to listen to, share, or edit later.
    </p> <p>  
      If a user wishes to edit a previously created ShortSound, the user would select the desired ShortSound from the ShortSound library.  Then the user could either add or remove tracks from the ShortSound or add effects to the current tracks in the ShortSound.  The user could then save and/or share the edited ShortSound.
