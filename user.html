      Product Description
    </h3>
    <p>
      ShortSounds is an Android application that allows users with absolutely no experience to record, mix, and add effects to tracks.  To begin creating a ShortSounds, a user simply records a sound and then adds any desired effects with the simple, intuitive interface.  The user can repeat this process to add more and more tracks to their ShortSounds, adjusting effects and volumes as they go, until they create their desired finished product.  After the user creates the perfect masterpiece of blended and manipulated sounds, they can share their creation with their friends or save their sound in the application’s library to come back to and listen to or edit later.  This application is unique because it is simple and intuitive to use, allowing even individuals with no experience to easily create a sounds to share with all of their friends.

    <p>
      A ShortSound is essentially a compilation of separate tracks that each have their own effects.  In order to demonstrate this concept, each track within a ShortSound has its own separate view, where effects can be added and adjusted.
    </p> <p>  
      Effects are designed to be as intuitive as possible, modeled as either adjustable knobs that the user can slide up and down, as with effect controllers in the real world, or modeled as a graph where changes along the x axis affects one variable, and changes along the y axis affect the other variable.
    </p> <p>
      The ShortSounds library is modeled after other software music libraries, with all of the ShortSounds in a list, along with a share button and a play button for each individual sound.
    </p> <p>  
      If a user wishes to create a new ShortSound, the user will first record a track.  After that, the user has the option to add effects to the track or record another track.  Effects can always be added or adjusted later after recording new tracks as well.  After recording and editing as many tracks as desired, the user will save their ShortSound to the ShortSound library to listen to, share, or edit later.
    </p> <p>  
      If a user wishes to edit a previously created ShortSound, the user would select the desired ShortSound from the ShortSound library.  Then the user could either add or remove tracks from the ShortSound or add effects to the current tracks in the ShortSound.  The user could then save and/or share the edited ShortSound.

      How to use the software
    </h3>
    <p>
      To begin, open up the application on your Android device.  
    </p>
    <h5>Record a Track</h5>
    <p>  
      The application’s home screen should have the words “RECORD A SOUND” and a red recording button. To begin recording, press the button. When you are finished, press the red recording button for a second time to stop the recording.
      Once you have a track recorded, you can either add effects to that track or a previously recorded track from your current ShortSound, save your ShortSound, or record a new track.  To record a new track, simply press the record button again to begin recording, and again to stop the recording, just as with your first track.
    </p>
    <h5>Add effects to a Track</h5>
    <p>  
      After you have recorded a track, there will be options for different effects to add in a box, as seen in the second phone diagram on the top of Figure 1.  If you have more than one track recorded, the tracks will be shown in layers as seen in the middle phone diagram on the bottom of Figure 1.  Touch the layer of the track that you wish to edit.  Pick one of the different effects options, and a screen will be displayed with either knobs or a graph to adjust the different components of the effect.  For example, if Reverb was the selected effect a graph would pop up as seen in the third phone diagram on the top of Figure 1.  Simply move the point up and down to adjust echo and left and right to adjust length.  As you are adding effects, you may press the green triangle play button near the track name to hear how the track sounds with the effect you are adding.  Alternatively, if you wish to hear how the whole ShortSound sounds with the effect that you are adding, you can press the large green play button on the bottom left of the screen.  Once you are done adjusting the effect, you can press the back arrow to return to the screen with all of your tracks, as shown in the top right phone diagram of Figure 1.  Now, there should be a checkmark next to the effect that you just added to the sound to show that the effect has been added to the track.  From here, you can either add another effect to this track or another track, record a new track, save your ShortSound to your library, or share your ShortSound.
    </p>
    <h5>Save a ShortSound to Your Library</h5>
    <p>  
      After you are content with your ShortSound and would like to save it to your library to listen to or work on again later, click the three dots in the upper right corner.  A menu will pop up.  Select save.  If you have not previously saved this ShortSound, you will be prompted for a name.  Type in a name for your ShortSound.  The saved ShortSound is available in your library.  From here, you can select the three dots in the upper right corner and select “New ShortSound” to start working on a new ShortSound, load a ShortSound from your library, or continue recording and/or adding effects to your current ShortSound.
    </p>
    <h5>Load a ShortSound From Your Library</h5>
    <p>  
      In order to view your library, click the drawer icon in the upper left coner.  The library will appear, as shown in the bottom left phone diagram in Figure 1.  From here, you can play any of the ShortSounds in your library by pressing the play button next to the name of the ShortSound you would like to play.  Once you decide on a ShortSound to work on, simply tap the name of the ShortSound to load it.  From here, you can either record a new track to add to your selected ShortSound, add effects to the tracks, share your ShortSound, or save your ShortSound.
    </p>
    <h5>Share a ShortSound</h5>
    <p>  
      There are two ways to share a ShortSound.  The first way is to share a ShortSound from your library.  Simply click the drawer icon in the upper left corner to open up your library.  From here, you can play any of the ShortSounds in your library by pressing the play button next to the name of the ShortSound you would like to play.  Once you decide on a ShortSound to share, tap the share button next to the green play button.  You will be given a list of different options of platforms on which to share your mp3 file that your ShortSound is saved on, including via Facebook and email if your phone is connected to these services.  Select your choice and share!
      The second way to share your ShortSound is by clicking the share button in the upper right corner (to the left of the menu button) while the ShortSound that you want to share is open.  You will be given a list of different options of platforms on which to share your mp3 file that your ShortSound is saved on, including via Facebook and email.  Select your choice and share!
